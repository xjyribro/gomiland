    Stark: Hey kid!
    Stark: Are you the one picking up rubbish from the streets...
    Stark: then sorting'em out at home?
    Stark: Our construction need some metal materials.
    Stark: If you help us we won't need to mine more ores.
    Stark: Toss 30 metal pieces in your bin and we'll pick'em up.

<<elseif $progress >= 30 and $progress < 100>>
    Stark: Yo kid!
    Stark: Wait a go on collecting those unwanted metal items.
    Stark: We could melt them down and reuse the metals.
    Stark: I'll give'ya extra coin for more.
    Stark: If you collect 50 more metals, I can make something neat.

    Stark: Woah woah where you goin' kid!
    Stark: We are going to be able to finish the construction...
    Stark: thanks to all the metals that you collected off the streets.
    Stark: Be ready to get more money for metals in the future.
