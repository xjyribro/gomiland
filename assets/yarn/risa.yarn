    Risa: Nice to meet you.
    Risa: My name is Risa. I work for Go 24hr convenient stores.
    Risa: I have been trying for months to convince the boss to reduce the single use plastics that our stores currently use.
    Risa: Hmm... could you help me?
    -> No
        Risa: Oh you don't have time?
        Risa: No worries
    -> Yes
        Risa: Great!
        Risa: Help me collect 30 plastics from the streets and I will show my boss that not only is it expensive,
        Risa: but it creates a lot of waste to use single ue plastics!
        <<changeProgress 0>>
<<elseif $progress < 30>>
    <<set $remainder = 30 - $progress>>
    Risa: Collect any plastic pieces you find and throw them at home.
    Risa: {$remainder} more to go!
<<elseif $progress >= 30 and $progress < 100>>
    Risa: Thank you for your effort.
    Risa: I have shown my boss the rubbish that you collected.
    Risa: He isn't convinced...
    Risa: I bet he needs more evidence. Could you collect another 50 more plastics please?
    Risa: I will also ask the city to increase the coins for plastics you throw as an incentive.
    <<changeProgress 100>>
<<elseif $progress < 150>>
    <<set $remainder = 150 - $progress>>
    Risa: Help me collect {$remainder} more plastics to show my boss!
<<else>>
    Risa: Thank you for your hard work.
    Risa: Unfortunately my boss didn't think the idea of reducing plastics was feasible...
    Risa: maybe if a customer went to see him, he would be persuaded. He values the customer a great deal.
    Risa: Look for him in front of the Gomiland office building between the hospital and the school.
    Risa: His name is Mr Kushi.
