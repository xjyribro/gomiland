    Asimov: ?? Oh hello...
    Asimov: I'm Asimov, builder of robots
    Asimov: Recently I've started building some self-thinking robots
    Asimov: I need more electronics to make them better.
    Asimov: Could you toss some electronics that no one wants into your bin?
    Asimov: Don't worry if they are broken. Asimov will make them work again.
    Asimov: I would go myself but I gotta keep an eye on these robots.
    Asimov: I think they are becoming sentient....

<<elseif $progress < 130>>
    <<set $remainder = 130 - $progress>>
    Asimov: Don't worry if they are broken. Asimov will make them work again.
<<elseif $progress >= 130 and $progress < 200>>
    Asimov: Oh it's you!
    Asimov: The electronics that you sent were perfect.
    Asimov: It's amazing how people just throw things that can still work.
    Asimov: How's the robot you ask?
    Asimov: Erm... they are not done yet.
    Asimov: More electronics!
    Asimov: 50 more to be precise.
    <<changeProgress 200>>
<<elseif $progress < 250>>
    Asimov: More electronics!
<<else>>
    Asimov: end
